# Tranlit Express
In lieu of being unable to successfully deploy the Ember.js version to Azure, I shift to using
ExpressJS as the MS docs use ExpressJS in their deployment example.

<hr>

## Running the Application

1. Go to the root directory and run ```npm install```
2. To run locally, run ```debug=myapp:* npm start```
3. Visit the website served on localhost:3000

### Directory Structure
1. website/ - ExpressJS frontend
2. back-end/ - MongoDB backend hosted on Azure
